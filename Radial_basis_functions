# Radial Basis Functions
x_dot = &(x) + u 
&(x) = w' * theta(x) + $(x)
theta(x) = exp(-b ||x-c||^2) 

- x is system state
- & is estimation of the system
- w' * theta(x) represents neural adaptive control component
- $ is model inaccuracies
- theta is radial basis function
  - b is control width of basis function
  - c is center of the radial basis function
  - ||x-c||^2 eucledian distance

The control input u is designed as
u = u_adaptive + u_nominal

- u_nominal --> Any control you like such as PID etc
- u_adaptive --> w_hat * theta
